# Manual Generation
In the rare case the release isn't up to date, you can generate the mappings yourself fairly easily using these steps.

1. Download and install [UE4SS for AbioticFactor](https://www.nexusmods.com/abioticfactor/mods/35).
2. Start game, enter world
3. Press Ctrl + Numpad 6
4. Check under `~\path\AbioticFactor\AbioticFactor\Binaries\Win64\ue4ss` for a file called Mappings.usmap

If the Mappings aren't the latest release and you don't have a numpad, go to UE4SS folder -> Mods -> Keybinds -> Scripts-> Main.lua
And edit the DumpUSMAP as wished. Example : NUM_SIX -> SIX (for top row).
